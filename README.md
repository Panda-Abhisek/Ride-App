# Ride-App

A ride-sharing application (Ride-App) providing passenger and driver interfaces with backend services for authentication, matching, and trip management.

> NOTE: This README was generated by an assistant without direct repository file access. It contains placeholders where exact commands and environment variables from backend/, frontend/, frontend_setup.md, and backend_setup.md should be inserted. If you want me to update the README with exact values, please allow me to scan the repository or paste those files and I'll update the README accordingly.

## Project Overview

Ride-App is designed to connect riders with drivers via a web/mobile frontend and a backend API. Core capabilities include user authentication, driver discovery, trip requests, pricing, and trip lifecycle management.

## Architecture

- frontend/ — Client application (web or React Native)
- backend/ — API server (handles authentication, trip logic, matching, notifications, DB)
- mobile/ (optional) — Mobile-specific client
- infra/ (optional) — Deployment manifests, Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests

(If your repo structure differs, replace the above after I scan your repo.)

## Features

- User (rider & driver) registration & authentication
- Real-time location updates (driver tracking)
- Ride request & matching
- Pricing and payment hooks
- Trip status updates & history
- Notifications (push / webhooks / emails)

## Tech Stack

This project likely uses:

- Backend: Node.js + Express / Django / Flask / FastAPI (replace with actual)
- Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB (replace with actual)
- Frontend: React / React Native / Vue (replace with actual)
- Real-time: WebSockets / Socket.IO / Pusher
- Other: Docker for containerization, CI via GitHub Actions (if present)

I will update these once I can read the repo files.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ / v16+ depending on project)
- npm or yarn
- Docker & Docker Compose (if you run services in containers)
- PostgreSQL / MongoDB (if not using Docker)
- Git

Replace versions above with project-specific versions found in repo.

### Backend Setup

1. Copy environment example and set variables:
   - cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   - Edit `backend/.env` to fill DB and other credentials.

2. Install dependencies:
   - cd backend
   - npm install
   - or
   - pip install -r requirements.txt (for Python projects)

3. Database setup / migrations:
   - npm run migrate
   - or
   - python manage.py migrate

4. Start backend in development:
   - npm run dev
   - or
   - flask run / uvicorn main:app --reload

(Replace the commands above with the exact commands from `backend_setup.md`. If you paste that file or allow scanning, I'll insert exact lines.)

### Frontend Setup

1. Copy environment and update:
   - cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
   - Edit FE env vars (API_URL, MAP_KEY, etc.)

2. Install dependencies:
   - cd frontend
   - npm install
   - or
   - yarn install

3. Start frontend in development:
   - npm start
   - or
   - yarn start

(Replace with exact commands from `frontend_setup.md`.)

## Environment Variables

Below are common env vars you should define. Replace with the project's exact list.

### Backend (example)
- PORT=4000
- DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
- JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
- REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
- SENTRY_DSN=...

### Frontend (example)
- VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
- REACT_APP_MAP_KEY=...
- REACT_APP_ENV=development

I will extract exact env variable lists from `backend_setup.md` and `frontend_setup.md` if you provide them or allow scanning.

## Running the App

### Development

- Start database (Docker Compose or local DB)
- Start backend: (see Backend Setup)
- Start frontend: (see Frontend Setup)
- Open http://localhost:3000 (or configured port)

### Production

- Build frontend:
  - cd frontend
  - npm run build
- Start backend with production config (process manager or container)
- Serve built frontend via CDN or backend static server or Nginx

## Testing

- Backend tests:
  - cd backend
  - npm test
  - or
  - pytest

- Frontend tests:
  - cd frontend
  - npm test
  - or
  - yarn test

(Insert project-specific test commands after I scan the repository.)

## Linting & Formatting

- ESLint for JS/TS
- Prettier for formatting
- Example commands:
  - npm run lint
  - npm run format

## Deployment

Common options:
- Docker + Docker Compose for simple deploy
- Docker images pushed to registry + Kubernetes manifests
- Host on Heroku / Vercel / Netlify for frontend
- Continuous deployment via GitHub Actions (add CI badge here if present)

If you have CI workflows in .github/workflows, I can include badges and details.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feat/your-feature
3. Write tests and keep code style consistent
4. Open a PR with a clear description and linked issue (if any)

Add any repo-specific contribution guides or code of conduct.

## License

Specify your license here (e.g., MIT). If `LICENSE` file exists in repo, replace this line with the license name and add license badge.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

- If backend fails to connect to DB: verify `DATABASE_URL` and DB availability
- If CORS errors occur: ensure frontend API URL is authorized in backend CORS config
- For detailed run steps see `backend_setup.md` and `frontend_setup.md` (please provide these files for precise instructions)

I can now:
- Re-scan the repository to replace placeholders with exact commands and environment variables (please allow a second scan),
- Or open a PR / push changes if you'd like me to commit the README (I just pushed it in this operation). 

If you want any edits to this README (badges, screenshots, more examples), tell me what to change.
